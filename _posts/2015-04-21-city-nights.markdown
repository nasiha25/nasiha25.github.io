###  single LED circuit
For a simple KiCad project, a single LED circuit is an excellent starting point. This circuit introduces the core KiCad workflow—creating a schematic, assigning footprints, and designing a basic PCB layout—with minimal components. 

### Components needed:
1 x Resistor (R)
1 x LED (D)
1 x Voltage source (VDC)
1 x Ground symbol (GND).
