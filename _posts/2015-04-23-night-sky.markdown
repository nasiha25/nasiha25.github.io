### How KiCad works?
The typical KiCad workflow follows a logical progression, with the schematic and PCB design files linked together within a single project.

Create a new project and a schematic file using the project manager.

Draw the schematic of your circuit by placing components from the symbol libraries and wiring them together.

Assign footprints to each component in your schematic. Footprints are the physical layouts on the PCB that the components will solder to.

Layout the PCB by arranging the components on the board and routing the electrical connections (traces) between them.

Run checks like the Electrical Rules Check (ERC) and Design Rules Check (DRC) to find errors in your schematic and layout.

Visualize the board in the 3D viewer to check clearances and aesthetic.

Generate manufacturing files once you are satisfied with the design. These files are used by PCB manufacturers to produce your physical circuit board.
