### Schematic Capture

Create your own custom symbols or use some of the thousands found in the official KiCad library. Verify your design with integrated SPICE simulator and electrical rules checker.

### PCB Layout
KiCad's PCB Editor is approachable enough to make your first PCB design easy, and powerful enough for complex modern designs. A powerful interactive router and improved visualization and selection tools make layout tasks easier than ever.

3D Viewer
KiCad's 3D Viewer allows easy inspection of your PCB to check mechanical fit and to preview your finished product. A built-in raytracer with customizable lighting can create realistic images to show off your work.
