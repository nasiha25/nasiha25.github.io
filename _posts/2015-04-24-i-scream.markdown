### Core features.
KiCad's integrated environment offers a comprehensive suite of tools for the entire electronic design process:

Schematic editor: Use a vast library of existing components or create your own custom symbols to build a circuit diagram. Features include hierarchical schematics for complex designs and an electrical rules checker (ERC).

Integrated simulation: Verify your circuit's behavior with the built-in SPICE simulator before committing to a physical layout.

PCB layout editor: Design the physical layout of your circuit board, from simple two-sided boards to complex, modern designs with up to 32 copper layers. It includes advanced features like a push-and-shove interactive router and customizable design rule checking (DRC).

Footprint and symbol editors: Create custom component footprints and schematic symbols to add to your personal libraries.

3D viewer: Inspect your PCB design in a 3D environment to check for mechanical fit and visualize the finished product.

Manufacturing file generation: Generate standard manufacturing files, such as Gerber files, bills of materials (BOM), and artwork, to send to a PCB fabrication house.

### Why Choose KiCad?
KiCad has become a popular choice in the electronics community for several reasons:

Completely free: KiCad is licensed under GNU GPL v3, making it free to use for both personal and professional projects without any feature limitations.

Open-source: With its open-source nature, KiCad benefits from a transparent development process and active community contributions.

Cross-platform: It runs seamlessly on all major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Professional capabilities: While approachable for beginners, KiCad offers features powerful enough for creating complex, professional-grade designs.

Growing community support: If you have questions or run into issues, an active user forum provides a robust source of help and information.
